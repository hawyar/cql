CQL (Clinical Quality Language) is a declarative domain-specific language to define clinical quality measures.
It is part of the HL7 FHIR specification made in an effort to standardize sharing clinical knowledge and measures.
CQL enables healthcare providers and researchers to address inquiries such as cancer screening, diabetes management, 
and other quality measures.
